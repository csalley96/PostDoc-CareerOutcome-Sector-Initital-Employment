# PostDoc-CareerOutcome-Sector-Initital-Employment
Postdoctoral Career Outcomes for Life Sciences at Johns Hopkins University (Sector and Type) from the Next Generation Life Science Coalition. 

The repository contains excel files with the original downloaded data and cluster analysis for data found on postdoctoral careers in the life sciences for students at Johns Hopkins University. Analyzed the sector of initial employment portion only, not the type of initial employment. 

# Description of Findings: 
After evaluating the minimum distance to each of the cluster nodes, it was found that a lot of these were clusted together in what was deemed as cluster 2. Cluster 1 and cluster 3 both only had a handful of departments in these groups. What these findings mean is that many departments in the life sciences have similarities in the job sectors they go to for initial employment. This could be important for current PhDs/PostDocs to know what sector a lot of Johns Hopkins alumni are going to, and if they are in the same cluster group their departments may have some similarites in terms of sector selection that they did not know about. For the institution, for career fairs or seminar series, they put these cluster groups together and tailor these types of networking and exposure to each group and where they typically end up for initial employment.

# Outline: 
Industry Question - How are departments in the Life Scieces clustered together at Johns Hopkins University based on their sector of initial employment?
Data Question - What data is available and what tools can be used to answer this industry question?
Data Answer - There is data found within the Next Generation Life Science Coalition database, which can then be extracted from Tabula. A cluster analysis with z-scores can be done to see the relationship we want to find. 
Industry Answer - The data is able to show us relationships between the department, and provides three cluster groups.
